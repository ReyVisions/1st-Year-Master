# Machine Learning Course Overview

This repository contains materials and resources from a machine learning course, covering various topics such as dimensionality reduction, sampling methods, Bayesian learning, and model combination techniques.

## Course Topics

### Dimensionality Reduction

- **Motivation and Types of Learning:**
  - Supervised Learning: Predicting a target variable.
  - Unsupervised Learning: No target variable provided.
  - Reinforcement Learning: Not covered in this course.

- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA):**
  - Linear transformation to reduce dimensionality while preserving variance.
  - Applications in data visualization and reducing overfitting.

- **Kernel PCA:**
  - Non-linear extension of PCA using kernel methods.
  - Useful for capturing complex structures in data.

- **Isomap:**
  - Method for non-linear dimensionality reduction using geodesic distances.
  - Useful for capturing the intrinsic geometry of data manifolds.

### Sampling Methods

- **Motivation and Basic Methods:**
  - Sampling from discrete and continuous distributions.
  - Gaussian vector sampling.

- **Rejection Sampling:**
  - Technique for generating samples from complex distributions.
  - Use of proposal distributions and acceptance criteria.

- **Importance Sampling:**
  - Weighted sampling to estimate expectations.
  - Useful for reducing variance in Monte Carlo simulations.

- **Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC):**
  - Metropolis-Hastings algorithm for generating samples from a probability distribution.
  - Useful for exploring complex, high-dimensional spaces.

- **Gibbs Sampling:**
  - Special case of MCMC for multivariate distributions.
  - Useful for sampling from conditional distributions.

### Bayesian Learning

- **Motivation and Bayesian Approach:**
  - Incorporating prior knowledge into learning models.
  - Updating beliefs with data using Bayes' theorem.

- **Bayesian Linear Regression:**
  - Bayesian approach to linear regression.
  - Incorporating uncertainty in model predictions.

- **Bayesian Kernel Regression:**
  - Extension of Bayesian linear regression using kernel methods.
  - Useful for non-linear regression tasks.

### Model Combination

- **Ensemble Methods:**
  - Combining multiple models to improve prediction performance.
  - Techniques such as bagging and boosting.

- **Bagging:**
  - Bootstrap aggregating to reduce variance.
  - Useful for models with high variance.

- **Boosting:**
  - Sequential training of models to reduce bias.
  - Useful for models with high bias.
